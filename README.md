# FreePad-V2

This is FreePad V2, the latest of my creations!

It contains 15 switches and one rotary encoder! 

You may ask whats v1? well v1 was a 5x3 layout with 3 of the 15 switches being a rotary encoder. It used a raspberry pi pico. This one uses a Seeed Xiao Rp2040 which saves loads on space!

It is also VERY slimmed down then the hungus and chungus of the FreePad V1

I hope you love it!
